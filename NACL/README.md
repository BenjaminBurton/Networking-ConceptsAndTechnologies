# Network Access Control List (ACL)

In networking, a Network Access Control List (NACL) is a set of rules that control 

the traffic flow in and out of a network subnet. NACLs are a form of firewall that 

operates at the subnet level rather than at the individual host level.

NACLs are used to allow or deny traffic based on a set of criteria. These criteria 

can include the source or destination IP address, protocol type, and port number. 

When traffic enters or exits a subnet, it is evaluated against the rules in the 

NACL. If a rule matches the traffic, the traffic is either allowed or denied based 

on the action specified in the rule.

NACLs are implemented in the networking infrastructure, typically on routers or 

other devices that can control traffic flow between subnets. In order to implement 

an NACL, you will need to identify the subnets that you want to control, and then 

configure the NACL rules on the appropriate networking devices.

Here's an example of how an NACL might be implemented:

Suppose you have a subnet with IP address range 10.0.0.0/24, and you want to allow 

traffic only from a specific IP address range (e.g., 192.168.0.0/16). You could 

create an NACL rule that looks like this:

```js
* Rule: Allow traffic from 192.168.0.0/16 to 10.0.0.0/24
* Action: Allow
```

This rule would allow traffic from any IP address in the 192.168.0.0/16 range to 

enter the subnet with IP address range 10.0.0.0/24. All other traffic would be 

denied by default, unless there are other NACL rules that allow it.

It's important to note that NACLs are stateless, meaning that they do not keep 

track of the state of connections. As a result, if you have traffic that requires a 

connection to be established (such as TCP traffic), you will need to create two 

rules: one to allow traffic to initiate the connection, and another to allow 

traffic to continue the connection. For example:

```js
* Rule 1: Allow TCP traffic from 192.168.0.0/16 to 10.0.0.0/24 on port 80 (HTTP)
* Action: Allow
* Rule 2: Allow TCP traffic from 10.0.0.0/24 to 192.168.0.0/16 on port 80 (HTTP)
* Action: Allow
```

These two rules would allow HTTP traffic to flow between the two subnets in both 

directions.

Overall, NACLs provide a powerful tool for controlling the flow of traffic in and 

out of subnets in a network, and can be a key component of network security.
